#Metribuzin Project
##Description
Given the widespread evolution of herbicide resistance in Palmer amaranth and waterhemp, which presents significant challenges for farmers, it is evident that an alternative approach to conventional weed management practices is urgently needed. To address this challenge, the study was conducted to explore the efficacy of metribuzin herbicide as a pre-emergence option to control herbicide resistant Amaranthus weeds (Palmer amaranth and waterhemp) in soybean while documenting the relative soybean response. Since dose of soil applied herbicide is highly varied based on the soil properties and environmental conditions. This study was conducted over 16 states in the U.S. over two years, encompassing variability in soil characteristics and precipitation levels, with 13 metribuzin rates tested along with the conventional pre-emergence options for farmers, sulfentrazone and S-metolachlor. We evaluated emergence pattern, weed control and soybean injury height and yield for the entire experiment. Crop injury of no more than 5% was recorded even with the highest dose of metribuzin.
